# Structural-Analysis-of-2D-UAP-Model

This project is part of the MA4700 Aircraft Structures II course at Nanyang Technological University. It involves the structural analysis of a UAP (Unmanned Aerial Platform) wing using ANSYS to evaluate its stress distribution, and weight optimization through ANSYS Workbench Topology Optimisation.
